        <h1>My Learning Journey</h1>
        <p>My learning journey began at Bongo Primary School, where I started school at the age of 7. Those early years helped me build a strong foundation in basic subjects and sparked my interest in learning.</p>

        <p>In 2017, I joined Pashikha Central School, where I continued my education until 2021. During these years, I developed critical thinking skills, participated in school activities, and explored subjects in more depth. I faced challenges but also celebrated achievements that shaped my academic and personal growth.</p>

        <p>Throughout my journey, I have been dedicated to learning, discovering my strengths, and pursuing my hobbies, which help me maintain a balanced and creative life. My learning journey has taught me the importance of curiosity, perseverance, and continuous self-improvement.</p>
